        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy based skillet or pot over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Add curry paste (and garlic, ginger and lemongrass Extras, if using) and cook for 2 to 3 minutes until it mostly “dries out” - see video. Don't breath in the fumes!!</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth and coconut milk, mix to dissolve paste.</li>
            <li>Curry in a jar seasonings: Add 1 tsp fish sauce, 1 tsp sugar, no salt.</li>
            <li>Homemade curry paste seasonings: Add 3 tsp fish sauce, 3 tsp sugar, 1/8 tsp salt.</li>
            <li>Add kaffir lime leaves. Mix then bring to simmer.</li>
            <li>Add chicken, stir then lower heat to medium so it's bubbling gently. Cook 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add eggplants, cook 5 minutes until soft.</li>
            <li>Taste sauce. Add fish sauce or salt for more saltiness, sugar for sweetness.</li>
            <li>Add snow peas, cook 2 minutes until a bit softened, then stir through basil and lime juice. Sauce should have reduced but will still be a be on the thin side, not thick - that's how it's should be. DO NOT keep simmering - sauce will darken.</li>
            <li>Serve curry over jasmine rice with garnishes of choice.</li>
        </ol>
