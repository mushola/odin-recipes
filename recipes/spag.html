        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
            <li>1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)</li>
            <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine (sub water or beef broth/stock)</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon (Note 2)</li>
            <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp cooking salt (kosher salt)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Saut√©</strong> - Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook beef</strong> - Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce wine</strong> - Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer</strong> - Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow simmer option</strong>: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 - 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
            <li><strong>Taste</strong> and add more salt it desired. Serve over spaghetti - though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
        </ol>
